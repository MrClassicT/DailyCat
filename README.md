# DailyCat: Your Daily Dose of Feline Fun

Welcome to the GitHub repository for DailyCat, the purr-fect Android app for cat lovers! DailyCat offers a delightful experience for anyone who adores felines. With an easy-to-use interface and a simple design with adorable habitants. DailyCat brings a daily dose of joy to your life with a variety of cat content. Let's dive into what makes DailyCat a must-have app for cat enthusiasts.

## Origin
This app was initially developed for my school Android project, but might get some updates later on as well. Depending on my personal free time and motivation. :p

## Features

- **CatPosts Feed:** Enjoy an endless scroll of cat photos and quotes. From fluffy kittens to majestic adult cats, our feed is filled with heartwarming and amusing feline content to brighten your day.

- **Favorites Tab:** Found a cat post that stole your heart? Simply mark it as a favorite! Your favorite catPosts are easily accessible in the Favorites Tab, ensuring you can revisit them anytime you need a smile.

- **Offline Accessibility:** Once you've marked posts as favorites, they are available offline. This feature makes DailyCat your go-to source for feline fun, even when you're not connected to the internet.

- **Discovery Tab:** Explore new and trending catPosts in the Discovery Tab. Note that this feature requires an internet connection, so make sure to connect to Wi-Fi or use mobile data to discover the latest and cutest (or silliest) cat content.
